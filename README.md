# LinuxKernel_buildHelper
a small script to help automate the building of the linux kernel so you don't have to remember stuff.

I've set this up to isolate everything into the cwd. So if you just want to run this, do it from within this repositories cloned directory.
Otherwise, I would recommend configuring the scripts variables, found at the top of the script, to use absolue paths for sanity reasons.
